## 🚫 What We Avoided

Based on client feedback, we explicitly avoided:

1. **"Modernise" or "Legacy"** - Could offend existing partners
2. **"Transform"** - Too aspirational/threatening
3. **"Practice Management Systems" everywhere** - Too specific
4. **"Practices" repeatedly** - Too dental-focused
5. **Overly aspirational tone** - Preferred grounded, practical
6. **Technology-only focus** - Added partnership/consultancy
